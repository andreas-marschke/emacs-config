;;; Commentary:

;; This spot of code extends M-x man with completion of man page names and
;; filenames, and a new default page name at point which collapses hyphens
;; (like nroff uses in formatted pages) and can optionally transform some
;; perl class names.
;;
;; iman.el does similar page name completion, with info documents too, but
;; not filename completion.  As of rev 2.22 it has the section number like
;; "cat(1)" and sets "require-match" so if you've got cat(1) and catdoc(1)
;; then you end up having to type "cat(" to differentiate, which is a bit
;; annoying.
;;
;; woman.el does a similar completion too, by going through /usr/share/man
;; etc to get a filename.  That's also what "bash_completion" does
;; (http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion).  But the strategy
;; in man-completion.el is to ask man what pages are available, rather than
;; digging.  It can potentially get aliases man has found with lexgrog but
;; which don't have symlinks (or ".so" pages).

;;; Install:

;; Put man-completion.el in one of your `load-path' directories and the
;; following in your .emacs
;;
;;     (eval-after-load 'man '(require 'man-completion))
;;
;; To use the smart perl module name at point default, add also
;;
;;     (setq man-completion-at-point-functions
;;           '(man-completion-transform-perl
;;             man-completion-transform-poco))
;;
;; There's an autoload cookie for this below, if you use
;; `update-file-autoloads' and friends.

;;; Emacsen:

;; Designed for Emacs 21 and 22, works in XEmacs 21.

;;; History:

;; Version 1 - the first version
;; Version 2 - avoid truncation to tty width on very long page names
;; Version 3 - new page at point transform scheme
;; Version 4 - disallow "[" except for sole "[" alias of "test(1)"
;; Version 5 - cope with non-existent `default-directory'
;; Version 6 - fix perl package name pruning when a section number too
;; Version 7 - notice man-db index file changes to refresh page names

;; page name at point

;; `man-completion-at-point-regexp' expresses what is a man page name.
;;
;; `chars' is the permitted characters.  The aim is to make this tight to
;; avoid punctuation in text or operators in program code.  `chars'
;; deliberately doesn't use the syntax table definition of a symbol char etc
;; so as to be mode-independent.  You can easily find man page names in
;; comments not really related to the programming language at hand.
;;
;; "." and "-" are allowed in the middle of a page name, but not as the
;; first or last char.  Disallowing a final dot in particular helps a page
;; name at the end of a sentence.  "+" is allowed in the middle or at the
;; end, but not at the start.  "+" at the end is needed for say "g++" and
;; other C++ stuff.
;;
;; "[" and "]" are disallowed like other parentheses, but there's a special
;; case in `man-completion-at-point' for "[" alone, the alias of the shell
;; "test" command.
;;
;; `man-completion-hyphen-regexp' matches a hyphenated line break like nroff
;; spits out, with dash chars in ascii, latin1 and unicode, all of which may
;; be used by groff according to its output mode.  Nroff breaks man page
;; names rather a lot in its output, unfortunately, so collapsing these is
;; important.  A hyphen is only recognised after two or more chars, since
;; pretty sure nroff doesn't break after just one.
;;
;; "::" is allowed for perl module names like B::Lint etc.  Each part must
;; be words per the `chars' rule above.  Don't think ":" occurs in a page
;; name apart from doubled for perl, but maybe that could be loosened (which
;; would simplify the regexp too).  A ":" at the end is disallowed though,
;; since that'd most often be punctuation.
;;
;; A "::" is deliberately not matched at the end, for the benefit of perl
;; code writing say Glib::Object:: for a class name.  In that case just
;; Glib::Object is the page name.
;;
;; A digit is allowed at the start of a page name.  This is unusual, but
;; found in things like the Debian "822-date" program.
;;
;; A section suffix like "chmod(2)" is matched only as a digit "(2)" or
;; digit and alnums like "(3X)" or "(3ncurses)".  The match is kept tight so
;; that if you've got program code like "exit(errors ? 0 : 1)" it won't get
;; the arg in parens, just the "exit".  Clearly this can be tricked by say
;; "exit(1)" as code, but a space is not matched so GNU style "exit (1)" is
;; ok.  It's expected that in comments or a document you won't put a space
;; before a section number.
;;
;; Alpha-only section IDs were, maybe still are, found on some non-free
;; systems.  One system of evil memory, which best remain nameless, but
;; which had letters S, C, and O in its name, had say "(S)" for system
;; commands or something like that.  Really not too interested in doing
;; anything for those at the moment.

Each entry is (NAME-STRING . nil), there's no value part

For a plain page like \"cat\" there's two entries, the plain name
and with its section

    \"cat\"
    \"1 cat\"

If there's two pages with the same name in different sections
then parenthesized section number forms are included too, so as

means completion stops there instead of after the \"(\".  Eg.
